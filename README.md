# Movie Organisation in Python

This repository contains a small set of Python functions that I wrote to sort a rather messy movie library directory structure into a flattened structure of files with the format `Movie Title [YEAR].EXTN`.

The functions in `movies_pass1.py` are documented, and should be fairly self explanatory.
